# Octave-convolution-sonnet

## TensorFlow-Sonnet implementation of Octave convolution
It is a third-party implementation of the paper 
[Drop an Octave: Reducing Spatial Redundancy in Convolutional Neural Networks with Octave Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05049)

## To Do List
- [x] [Code for ResNet](resnet.py)
- [ ] Code for the ablation study 
- [ ] Trained models (rest exps)

## Offical Implemetnation
- Thanks [Mxnet implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/OctConv), our models are mostly based on their code
